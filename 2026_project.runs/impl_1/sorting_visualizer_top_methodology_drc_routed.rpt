There is a large setup violation of -9.419 ns between insertion_renderer/p0_pixel_x_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and insertion_renderer/p1_title_color_reg[10]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
